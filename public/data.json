It's much better to have an original idea that is solving something specifically for you, because you'll be much more motivated to build it. I think cloning is even fine if there's a personal reason behind it - I love CLI programs, so I ended up cloning a version of Free Cell Solitaire that I used to play on the commandline when I first got into Linux. I was so into building it because of the nostalgia for playing that game and it felt very personal to me. I'm working on something now in React that has to do with tracking and suggesting things I want to do with my wife and family because I keep wishing I had a tool for that, and a ToDo list isn't really what I'm looking for. It's been great because it's scratching an actual itch I have, so I'm not just building components for no reason. That's what connects the pathways for me the most.",
